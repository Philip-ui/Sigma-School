    <h2 style="color: blue;">Intro about the project.</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">This project is about an app for a Vocal Learning Tracker. There's a login 
        and logout authentication and menu using react router. It can create, update, and delete
        individual lessons, that is 'Add Songs': A song title and lyrics of the song can be added, a 
        timer to see how long the practice takes, and a check box whether it is completed or not. 
        It has a, 'Schedule': for for vocal learning like tenor, soprano, bass and etc and the
        date and time for the practice and also a timer.
    </p>
    <h2 style="color: blue;">What is 1 challenge you face?</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The challenge I face is creating 'Add Songs' card and 'Schedule' card. I can't 
        use the same components, like TodoCard, AddTodo and etc. It won't work.
    </p>
    <h2 style="color: blue;">And how you resolve it or how you attempt to resolve it?</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Create another TodoCard that is TodoScheduleA, as for AddTodo is AddSchedule,
        and EditTodo is EditSchedule.
    </p>
    <h2 style="color: blue;">What you learnt from creating these projects?</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">I learnt to create, read, update and delete data in react js, use Bootstrap css,
        React router, Login and Logout and timer(useEffect).
