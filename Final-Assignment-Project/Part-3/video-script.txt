Hello, my name is Chong. In this video, I'm going to demo my baby, Cocktail
Search App project. This App does a search for a cocktail or cocktails using API 
endpoints called Cocktail by API-Ninjas. The backend part is coded in 
Javascript promise, async and await handlers. The look and feel of this 
web app are done by using flexbox and css on the html file, meaning the 
styling of this web app.

It's a one page web app. At the top is the cocktail icon and the catchy title.
Below left is the brief description of this app and instructions of how to use
this app. To the right is a picture of cocktails. Further down the greyish 
box is the place where you enter the cocktail name. Once the enter key is
pressed, it will display the cocktail name, ingredients and instructions
on how to make it. After this, below, is the Cocktail Blog where articles of 
the blogs are shown. Anyway, the cocktail 'Bloody Mary' is shown in the 
search box and ingredients are listed and also the instructions. You can 
type 'Bloody', for example and cocktails associated with 'Bloody' will be 
displayed. Next, on further testing, say 'asfdsf' is typed. This would 
resulted in no cocktails displayed and an error alert 'No results. Please 
enter cocktail name again' will pop up. Therefore a cocktail name must be 
entered again.

The feature I'm most proud of is creating div element and looping the list 
of ingredients for more than one cocktail names.

The one coding struggle I face is to create a 'for each' loop for ingredients 
to be insert into cocktailElement.innerHTML.

One improvement which I like to work on is to search for API endpoints that
can encompass all or more comprehensive the cocktail names in the world and
also display the cocktail picture for each cocktail name.

Thank you.
